# <u> Machine Learning Internship Project at Bharat Intern - Iris Classification Using SVM  (Tsak 1)</u>
### <i>In this project, our objective is to conduct an in-depth exploration  of the Iris dataset. We use Two distinct classification algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM)â€”to forecast The Specisies of the Iris flowers. Furthermore, we use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for comprehensive forecasting .</i>
